# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 29, 2025**

## Overview

QueryVeil is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the extension works and what data (if any) is collected.

## Data Collection

### What We DO NOT Collect

QueryVeil does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit:

- ❌ Your real search queries
- ❌ Your browsing history
- ❌ Generated noise queries (they exist only in memory)
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Analytics or telemetry data
- ❌ Usage statistics beyond local counters
- ❌ IP addresses or device identifiers

### What We DO Store (Locally Only)

QueryVeil stores the following data **locally on your device**:

- ✅ Your preferences (intensity level, enabled topics, schedule settings)
- ✅ Statistics counters (total number of queries generated - not the queries themselves)
- ✅ Extension state (whether it's active, paused, or inactive)

**Important**: All stored data remains on your device. It is never transmitted to external servers.

## Permissions Explanation

QueryVeil requests the following permissions:

### `storage`
- **Why**: Store your preferences and settings locally
- **What we do**: Save your chosen intensity level, topic preferences, and schedule
- **What we don't do**: Store actual queries or browsing data

### `alarms`
- **Why**: Schedule noise queries at realistic human-like intervals
- **What we do**: Create timers for when to generate the next query
- **What we don't do**: Access any of your data or alarms

### `idle`
- **Why**: Detect if you're actively using your computer
- **What we do**: Adjust query frequency based on activity (more queries when active)
- **What we don't do**: Track what you're doing or store activity patterns

### `host_permissions` (Search Engines)
- **Why**: Send noise queries to search engines
- **What we do**: Make HTTP requests to Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo with generated queries
- **What we don't do**: Access any page content or inject scripts

## Third-Party Services

### Search Engines
QueryVeil sends generated noise queries to search engines (Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo based on your settings).

- These queries are **generated by the extension**, not your real searches
- Search engines will see these queries as coming from your browser
- Search engines may set cookies (same as if you searched normally)
- We have no control over search engine privacy policies

### No Other Third Parties
QueryVeil does not communicate with any other third-party services, APIs, or servers.

## How Noise Queries Work

1. QueryVeil generates realistic search queries using Markov chains and topic models
2. Queries are created **entirely in memory** - never written to disk
3. Queries are sent to the selected search engine using your browser's fetch API
4. After sending, the query is immediately discarded from memory
5. Only a counter is incremented (e.g., "total queries: 157")

**Example**: If QueryVeil generates "best italian restaurants near me", that exact text is never stored anywhere. Only the count "158 total queries" is updated.

## Your Rights

### Access
All data stored by QueryVeil is in your browser's local storage. You can:
- View it using browser developer tools
- Export it manually
- Delete it by uninstalling the extension

### Control
You have complete control:
- Enable/disable the extension at any time
- Pause noise generation temporarily
- Adjust intensity and topics
- Uninstall to remove all data

### Deletion
To delete all QueryVeil data:
1. Uninstall the extension, or
2. Clear browser extension data from Firefox settings

## Security

### Local Operation
- All processing happens locally on your device
- No external communication except to search engines
- No telemetry or phone-home functionality

### No Logging
- Debug mode (when enabled) only logs to your browser console
- Logs are not transmitted or stored permanently
- Console logs disappear when you close the browser

### Open Source
- All code is available for inspection
- You can verify exactly what the extension does
- Community audits are encouraged

## Children's Privacy

QueryVeil does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal data, no special provisions are needed.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Changes will be:
- Reflected in the "Last Updated" date
- Announced in extension update notes
- Available in the extension repository

## Contact

For privacy concerns or questions:
- Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/NOTz00m/queryveil/issues)

## Transparency Promise

QueryVeil is built on these principles:

1. **Privacy by Design**: We can't collect what we don't capture
2. **Data Minimization**: We only store what's absolutely necessary
3. **User Control**: You decide when and how it runs
4. **Open Source**: Verify our claims by reading the code
5. **No Monetization**: No ads, no data selling, no hidden agendas

---

**Summary**: QueryVeil generates fake search queries to protect your privacy. It doesn't log or store these queries. Your settings are stored locally. That's it.
